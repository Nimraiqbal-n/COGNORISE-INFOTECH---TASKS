# BMI Calculator with Dynamic Chart

## Project Overview
This project is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that allows users to calculate their BMI by entering their gender, weight, and height. It also provides additional health information based on the user's BMI and displays the results dynamically using a bar chart powered by Chart.js.

## Features
- **BMI Calculation**: Calculate BMI based on user input (weight in kg and height in cm).
- **Health Insights**: Provides health insights like BMI Prime and Ponderal Index along with the healthy weight range.
- **Dynamic Chart**: Visual representation of BMI categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) with dynamic updates based on user input.
- **Responsive Design**: Aesthetic and responsive UI design using HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For implementing BMI calculation logic and updating the chart dynamically.
- **Chart.js**: For rendering and updating the bar chart dynamically.

## Files and Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML structure for the BMI Calculator.
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for the layout and design.
- `script.js`: Contains JavaScript logic for calculating BMI and updating the chart.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter your gender, weight (in kg), and height (in cm), then click "Calculate BMI."
4. The results and additional health information will be displayed below the form, and the chart will be updated dynamically.

## Instructions
1. **Enter Gender**: Select male or female.
2. **Enter Weight**: Input your weight in kilograms.
3. **Enter Height**: Input your height in centimeters.
4. **Calculate BMI**: Click on the button to see the calculated BMI and associated health information.
5. **Check Chart**: The chart updates to highlight your BMI category.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a toggle for metric and imperial units (kg/cm to lbs/inches).
- Add support for additional age-based or gender-specific health recommendations.
- Allow users to save or export their results.
